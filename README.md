# Job Extractor

A simple developer-prototype job scraper.

This project fetches a job posting URL (currently tuned for LinkedIn) and extracts:
- **Title**
- **Company**
- **Location**
- **Job Description** (clean text snippet)

This is a simple learning + developer project designed to evolve into a production scraper.
